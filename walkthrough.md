<br>

**Some notes about the walkthrough:**  
- The walkthrough can be used with both the unpatched game and the patched game. I'd recommend using my patch, but the walkthrough can be followed exactly the same without it.
- Skipping the intro will prevent you from getting the day 1 romance point with the mom, so even if you are replaying the game you shouldn't skip the intro.
- If there is a choice or event that isn't mentioned in the walkthrough that means it's a choice that doesn't affect anything and you can choose any option.

### The Hole:
- Explore all the rooms on Floor 2, break all the vases, and open all the chests
  - Using an antiandrogen will remove 30-50 arousal, but try not to use them if you don't need to
  - A good strategy for exploring the floor is to go counterclockwise around the map

I forgot that someone sent me this a while ago. It was tips they had for the next few days after my walkthrough stopped. I haven't read it yet so I'm not sure if they are choices I would have made, but here it is if you still need help.
```
9/15
After giving money the mom, go to the school, English litrature class is on,
I get by randomly 2 questions answers were: boner and nudes,
questions are about lewd stuff, go to uncle and agree with the shop,
place toys on to the shelves and open the shop first time

9/16

```

<!---

so sunday violet is available at playground, but i skip the scene to read teh book which i cant even use yet though...

Keep track of:
Money
Violet romance level
Antiandrogen.


3/4:
- Once you've played past the first week, if you reach 100 arousal the game will penalize you and you will deviate a bit from the walkthrough. If this happens then you should reload your your last save and use an antiandrogen to lower your arousal and make sure it doesn't reach 100.


- room read book

- hypno nat

- shop stuff
(can save game in town!!)


Friday:
mom stuff
new quest
class - +1 charm (nothing else special)


gift bear to violet + hangout - 3 left
