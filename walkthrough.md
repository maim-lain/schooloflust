<br>

**Some notes about the walkthrough:**  
- I'm super perfectionist, so you don't actually have to save-whore and get max points every time you play a mini-game even though the guide says to do that. That's just me being autistic and isn't actually necessary.
- The walkthrough can be used with both the unpatched game and the patched game. I'd recommend using my patch, but the walkthrough can be followed exactly the same without it.
- Skipping the intro will prevent you from getting the day 1 romance point with the mom, so even if you are replaying the game you shouldn't skip the intro.

### The Hole:
- Explore all the rooms on Floor 2, break all the vases, and open all the chests
  - Using an antiandrogen will remove 30-50 arousal, but try not to use them if you don't need to
  - A good strategy for exploring the floor is to go counterclockwise around the map
  - I'd recommend starting by going: Left -> Down -> Left, because in the third room a girl will charge at you as soon as you enter the room so it's best to go there when you start so you aren't caught off guard later
